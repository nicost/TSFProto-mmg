##  Extension to the tagged spot file format (.tsf) 

Nico Stuurman, Feb. 2017

This repository contains an extension to the tagged spot file format (tsf), which itself is hosted [here on github](http://https://github.com/nicost/TSFProto/tree/master). This particular extension is used by the [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org) Localization Microscopy plugin, but it can also serve as an example how to create your own extension. MMG stands for Micro-Manager Gaussian.
